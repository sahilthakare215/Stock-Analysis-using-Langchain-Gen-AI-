# Stock Analysis using Gemini and LangChain

This notebook demonstrates how to use the Gemini API, LangChain, and yfinance to perform basic stock analysis. It fetches historical stock data and simulated news, and then uses a large language model (Gemini) to provide an analysis, investment tips, and insights.

## Requirements

*   **Google API Key**: You need a Google API key to use the Gemini API. You can obtain one from the Google AI Studio. Store this key securely in Colab's Secrets Manager with the name `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
*   **Python Libraries**: The notebook requires the following libraries, which are installed in the first cell:
    *   `langchain`
    *   `google-generativeai`
    *   `yfinance`

## Setup

1.  **Install Libraries**: Run the first code cell to install the necessary libraries.
2.  **Set up API Key**:
    *   Click the "ðŸ”‘" icon in the left sidebar of Colab.
    *   Click "Add new secret".
    *   For the "Name", enter `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
    *   For the "Value", enter your Google API key.
    *   Ensure the "Notebook access" checkbox is ticked.
3.  **Run Initial Cells**: Execute the cells to import libraries and configure the Gemini API.

## Usage

1.  **Run Code Cells**: Execute the code cells sequentially.
2.  **Enter Ticker Symbol**: When prompted, enter the stock ticker symbol you want to analyze (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple or `RELIANCE` for Reliance Industries on NSE). The notebook automatically appends `.NS` for Indian stock tickers if not provided.
3.  **View Analysis**: The notebook will display a summary of the stock's historical price data, simulated news articles, and then provide an analysis generated by the Gemini model, including historical performance analysis, investment tips, and hidden insights.

## Components

*   **`yfinance`**: Used to fetch historical stock price data.
*   **Simulated News**: For demonstration purposes, a function `fetch_stock_news_simulated` is used to provide example news articles. In a real-world application, you would integrate with a news API.
*   **LangChain**: Used to structure the prompt and interact with the Gemini model.
*   **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: The large language model used to analyze the data and generate the stock analysis report.

## Disclaimer

This notebook provides a basic framework for stock analysis using AI. The simulated news is not real, and the AI-generated analysis should not be considered financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
